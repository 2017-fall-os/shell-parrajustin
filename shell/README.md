# Parra Justin Shell

- token library I created in token.c
- Shell main code in shell.c
  - I have comments for util, exe, and main
  - under the util comment exist most of the utilities to run the program like concating strings and their lengts
  - under exe comment exists code to execute the commands like pipes and redirecting inputs
  - under main comment is the main function

## note: still can't get ps1 thing to work

```
make 
./myShell
```

or 

```
make run
```
